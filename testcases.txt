1) Correct case
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	My client receives it and sends back "REG|12|Who's there?|"
	S -> "REG|3|Ya."
	C -> "REG|8|Ya, who?"
	S -> "REG|46|No thanks, I don't like having my data stolen.|"
	C -> "REG|4|Ugh."
	
	This interaction goes off cleanly and the server terminates the connection after receiving the final message from the client.
	
2) Who is it?
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	My client sends back "REG|10|Who is it?|"
	The server recognises this is incorrect content and sends the client "ERR|M1CT|" before shutting down the connection.
	
3) "Server error"
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	My client incorrectly decides this is an error and sends back the error message "ERR|M0LN|"
	The server receives the error message, prints it to stdout, and shuts down the connection.
	
4) Left me hanging
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	The client fails to send the entire response; it sends "REG|12|Who's there"
	The server will hang until the client either closes, or sends the final '|' to the server.
	
5) Length error
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	Client responds with either "REG|10|Who's there?|" or "REG|10|Who?|"
	The server will detect that the content payload is not 10 bytes long, and will send "ERR|M1LN|" to the client before shutting down.
	
6) <NUMBER>
	Server starts, client connects.
	My server sends "REG|13|Knock, knock.|"
	Client responds with "REG|TWELVE|Who's there?|"
	The server recognises that the length field has non-numerical chars in it and sends back "ERR|M1FT|" before shutting down.
